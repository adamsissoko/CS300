## CS300 Advanced Programming Concepts: School Course Management System 

### Project Description
For the CS300 course, I developed a sophisticated School Course Management System aimed at reading and interpreting data from .CSV files. The system offers users the ability to easily access and manipulate detailed information about their school courses.

### Technical Approach
To ensure the project's success, I began by drafting pseudocode as an outline for the software's functionality. This early planning phase was crucial for identifying the core features and planning the software architecture. Understanding the importance of data structures was fundamental to the project. Data structures allow for efficient data storage and manipulation, and they are essential in tackling real-world problems, making them a cornerstone in computer science careers.

### Problem-Solving Strategy
When faced with challenges, my go-to strategy involved in-depth online research. Utilizing platforms like Reddit and StackOverflow, I engaged with the programming community to seek advice and alternative solutions. I also revisited previous course materials and peer discussions to overcome roadblocks effectively.

### Skill Development
The project has been an eye-opener in terms of the multitude of methods available for solving a single problem. It introduced me to the versatile application of vectors in software development.

### Code Quality
This experience has been instrumental in refining my coding practices. I've learned the importance of making code readable and maintainable, focusing on clear variable naming and straightforward logic. This is particularly beneficial for long-term project sustainability and team collaboration.

This project serves as an excellent example of my problem-solving skills, understanding of data structures, and commitment to producing high-quality, maintainable code. Feel free to reach out for further information or inquiries about the project.
