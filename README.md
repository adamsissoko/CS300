<h1 align="center">School Course Management System: A Data-Driven Approach for Academic Course Management</h1>
<h2 align="center">Adam Sissoko</h2>

### Introduction and Objective
The School Course Management System aims to simplify the intricate task of managing academic course data. With a focus on providing a straightforward interface for non-technical users, the platform can interpret data from .CSV files. Its primary use case involves making academic and administrative procedures more efficient by allowing easier data retrieval and enabling certain advanced data manipulation functions.

### System Architecture: Ensuring Flexibility and Scalability
The architecture of the School Course Management System is modular, built with the idea that each component can function independently but contribute to the system as a whole. This allows for better maintainability and makes future expansions less complicated. One of the key elements in the system design was efficient parsing of .CSV files to populate a relational database. This enables not just straightforward queries but also more advanced data operations, all without compromising data integrity or system performance.

### Techniques for Data Management
Data storage and retrieval were crucial aspects of this project. Basic data structures like arrays and linked lists are employed where quick, sequential data access is needed. For operations requiring quick data lookup, hash maps were implemented. This is to ensure that as the dataset grows, the system remains efficient in fetching the required information.

### Quality Assurance Through Testing
To verify the system's functionality, unit tests were created focusing on key parts of the application, particularly those involving data parsing and manipulation. This was done to make sure that the system behaves as intended in different scenarios. Additionally, to make the code understandable for anyone who might work on it in the future, conventional naming standards were used along with comments to clarify the more complex parts of the code.

### Collaborative Tools and Project Management
The project was managed using Git for version control. This was particularly helpful for tracking changes and making reversions where necessary. For day-to-day task management and to keep track of project milestones, a Kanban board was used. It helped to visualize the workflow, allocate resources effectively, and track progress in a transparent manner.

### Features Aimed at User Convenience
- **Bulk Data Import/Export through CSV**: This feature was developed to minimize the time spent on manual data entry by allowing users to upload or download data in batches.
- **Role-Specific Access Control**: The system has different user roles such as 'Administrator,' 'Faculty,' and 'Student,' and each role has its own level of access, ensuring that users interact only with the functionalities they are supposed to.
- **Advanced Search Functionality**: The search feature allows users to locate specific courses using various parameters like course name, instructor name, or even time schedules.
- **Automated Summary Reports**: With a focus on delivering actionable insights, the system automatically generates reports that summarize key metrics like student enrollments, faculty assignments, and more.

### Conclusion
The School Course Management System was developed with the intention of making academic and administrative tasks simpler and more efficient. It represents a humble effort to understand and implement effective data structures and quality coding practices.
