## CS300 School Course Management System: Data-Driven Academic Course Management

### Overview
The School Course Management System was designed to provide an efficient and user-friendly platform for managing and interpreting academic course data from .CSV files. The system not only facilitates easy data retrieval but also allows for complex data manipulations, ideal for administrative and academic use.

### Architecture and Design
The system follows a modular architecture to ensure separation of concerns. It efficiently parses .CSV files to populate a relational database, allowing for more complex queries and data manipulations down the line. Data integrity and system performance were key considerations during the design phase.

### Data Handling Techniques
Special attention was paid to the use of efficient data structures for storage and retrieval, such as arrays and linked lists for quick access. Hash maps were employed for constant-time lookup operations, which is particularly useful when the system is scaled to accommodate larger datasets.

### Testing and Code Quality
Unit tests were developed to cover critical parts of the code, ensuring that the data parsing and manipulation functionalities work as expected. To maintain code quality and readability, standard naming conventions were followed, and code comments were used judiciously to explain complex operations.

### Collaboration Tools and Workflow
Version control was managed through Git, facilitating easy rollbacks and feature branching. Task assignments and progress tracking were handled through a simple Kanban board, enabling a clear overview of project milestones.

### Notable Features
- **CSV Import/Export**: Allows users to batch-import or export course details, reducing manual data entry effort.
- **Role-Based Access**: Different user roles such as 'Administrator,' 'Faculty,' and 'Student,' each with their own set of permissions and accessible features.
- **Data Queries**: A search functionality that can filter and sort courses based on various parameters like course name, instructor, or schedule.
- **Report Generation**: Automatic generation of summary reports that provide insights into course enrollments, faculty assignments, and other critical metrics.

The School Course Management System aims to showcase a methodical approach to problem-solving, an understanding of efficient data structures, and a commitment to high-quality code. For additional details or inquiries about the project, feel free to reach out.
