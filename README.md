## CS300 Advanced Programming Concepts: School Course Management System

### Project Overview
This School Course Management System, developed as part of the CS300 course, is designed to read and interpret data from .CSV files. The system provides users with a reliable and user-friendly platform for accessing and managing detailed information about academic courses.

### Technical Approach
The project commenced with a planning phase that included drafting pseudocode to outline key functionalities. This served as a crucial roadmap for developing the system's architecture. A core aspect of the project was the effective utilization of data structures, essential for enabling efficient data storage and manipulation.

### Problem-Solving Strategy
When encountering challenges, the approach involved rigorous online research. Valuable insights were gathered from programming forums such as Reddit and StackOverflow. Additionally, previous course materials and peer interactions were revisited to surmount obstacles effectively.

### Skill Enhancement
The project provided an opportunity to explore diverse methodologies for problem-solving, particularly highlighting the effective use of vectors in software development.

### Code Quality
Emphasis was placed on writing code that is both readable and maintainable. This focus on quality is intended to aid in long-term sustainability and to simplify team-based collaboration.

This project aims to be a representation of both technical skill in problem-solving and a commitment to generating maintainable, high-quality software. For additional information or queries regarding the project, please feel free to reach out.
