###### What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

For the projects in this course, the main goal was to create a system that would read information from a .CSV file, and give the user the ability tofind information about their school courses.

###### How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I approached this problem by first creating some pseudocode. The pseudocode was extremely helpful because it helped me build an outline of how the software would work, and keep track of the features that I would need to include in order for the system to work properly. It is imprtant to understand data structures because they have a huge range of real-world applications, and you will need to know about them if you decide to pursue a career in computer science. Without a deep understanding of data structures, it's very challenging to build complex systems, or use software to solve real-workd issues.


###### How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

I overcame many of the roadblocks by doing research online. There are many forums like Reddit or StackOverflow where I can communicate with other programmers, and get advice and explanations regarding the problem that I'm struggling with. I also made an effort to review some of the previous modules, or even my classmate's discussion posts. That was very helpful, and eventually I was able to complete the project.

###### How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

Working on this project has given me a newfound respect for the programmers that design complex systems. I never knew that there were so many ways to approach a single problem, and although I had heard of vectors before, I never knew that they could be used to create software.

###### How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Working on this project has really helped me make a habit of adding edits to my code to enhance readability. I've also been making a stronger effort to avoid confusing variable names, and make all of my code as direct/straightforward as possible.
